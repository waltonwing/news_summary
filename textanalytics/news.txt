WASHINGTON—Attorney General Merrick Garland defended special counsel Jack Smith in his first public comments since the unprecedented federal indictment of former President Donald Trump, who has lashed out at prosecutors and called himself the victim of a political prosecution.

“As I said when I appointed Mr. Smith, I did so because it underscores the Justice Department’s commitment to both independence and accountability,” Garland said Wednesday, a day after Trump’s arraignment in Miami. “Mr. Smith is a veteran career prosecutor. He has assembled a group of experienced and talented prosecutors and agents who share his commitment to integrity and the rule of law.” 

“Any questions about this matter will have to be answered by their filings in court,” the attorney general said, declining to discuss specifics of the 37-count indictment related to Trump’s handling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago resort.

Garland, who has deliberately kept his distance from the special counsel’s investigation, said he had adhered to regulations that give Smith broad discretion to make decisions and bring charges. Those rules require Smith to notify the attorney general of significant events, meaning Garland would have been consulted about the indictment and allowed it to proceed.
